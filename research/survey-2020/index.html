<h2 id="1-survey">1. SURVEY</h2>
<h3 id="survey-background">Survey Background</h3>
<p>The survey was conducted over Google Forms, and publicity was done through various messaging applications and social media. Responses of voluntary surveyees were collected and analyzed. As a result of the means of data collection, a large proportion of surveyees (~69%) are youths aged 16-20. The surveyees are from a large spread of countries, with the 2 highest frequencies being France (12) and Hong Kong (12).</p>
<h3 id="survey-data-analysis">Survey Data Analysis</h3>
<h4 id="question-1---what-measures-has-your-government-undertaken-to-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus">Question 1 - What measures has your government undertaken to stop the spread of coronavirus?</h4>
<p>When asked what measures their countries have implemented, the most frequent responses were closure of public venues (64), school suspension (65) and restrictions of public gatherings (66). This is certainly a good sign and shows that a large proportion of governments are taking measures to prevent large groups clustering at areas. This can certainly effectively combat the virus by reducing its spread.</p>
<p>However, only a small proportion of people indicated that their governments have implemented free tests for new arrivals (25) and free distribution of health supplies (21). These are costly measures that are simply unattainable for some governments, but still crucial to combating COVID-19. Free tests for new arrivals are crucial to preventing imported cases from entering a country, which could be detrimental to countries that currently have a low number of infections. Free health supplies such as masks are important for further limiting the spread of the virus at places such as supermarkets where large groups are found, and necessary to reduce the impacts of irresponsible hoarding behaviour.</p>
